# A log of issues encountered as I build this app.

* trouble w/ 'block' and nested templates. Seem to have figured out.

* Can the same URL handle POST and GET or do they have to be separate URLs?
  - yes, just get() and post() the same path.
* but what's the best way to handle the same form with or without POSTed data?
