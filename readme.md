# Spanish Flashcards in Node.js
## by Ben Buckman, newleafdigital.com

This is a little app to help me learn two things at once: node.js (and its surrounding ecosystem) and Spanish.

To run:
# Create a PASSWORD file in the root to set the login password. (Otherwise won't allow access.)
# Run the app (`node app.js`)
