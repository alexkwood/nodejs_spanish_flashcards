# Spanish Flashcards in Node.js
## by Ben Buckman, newleafdigital.com

This was a little app to help me learn two things at once: node.js (and its surrounding ecosystem) and Spanish.

**An expanded version of this app is now part of the New Leaf Digital Apps suite: code at [nld-apps-hq](https://github.com/newleafdigital/nld-apps-hq) and hosted at [apps.newleafdigital.com](http://apps.newleafdigital.com).**


To run:

* Create a config.js file in the root. See example.config.js.
* Run the app (`node app.js`)

You can run **multiple instances** of the app with different --db and --port parameters.

Post about this app and lessons learned from coding it is [here](http://benbuckman.net/tech/11/10/exploring-nodejs-frontier).
